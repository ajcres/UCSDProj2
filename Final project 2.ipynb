    "This program has two abilities, the first one is to take an image file and detect if it contains faces, while showing an image showing boxes arround the detected faces and eyes.\n",
    "The second function is to use the computor's webcam to take images and do the same process in realtime\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the process that the program goes throught when the cells are ran in order:\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic setup: (everyone worked together and on the parts pertaining to their specific code)\n",
    "    1. Install the python version of OpenCV for use in face detection and showing the output window\n",
    "    2. Imports all of the relevant libraries including cv2, tkinter (and its file selection dialog code), and PIL (only the Image and ImageTK components)\n",
    "    3. Set up variables that are global or constant\n",
    "    4. Have the user select the XML files for face and eye detection from their computor (the download links are before the relevant cells)\n",
    "    5. If this does not work an error should be printed and the user should re-run that cell\n",
    "    \n",
    "UI setup: (Andy)\n",
    "    1. Using tkinter create a window with a title (Face recognizer) and four buttons (Select file, Use webcam, run, and quit)\n",
    "    2. Setup the buttons to run their respective functions when clicked and disable the run button untill a file is selected properly\n",
    "    3. If the Quit button or the close button in the window are pressed the close function will be ran to insure proper closeure of the windows and program\n",
    "    4. If the Select file button is used the program will start on the image face detection path and if the Use webcam button is used the program will start on the webcam realtime face detection path\n",
    "    \n",
    "Image face detection: (UI: Andy, Image/Logic programming: Bruge, implementing machine learning: Eric)\n",
    "    1. Once the Select file button is pressed the user can select a file that is an image type that can work both with tkinter and OpenCV which will then be used to create a comboImage object that contains image data for both formats\n",
    "    2. The ui then shows this image (either creating it or replacing the previous one) and scales down it to fit the window if it is too big and then re-adjusts the window accordingly\n",
    "    4. If the Run button is pressed than the checkImage function is started and the saved comboImage object is used with with OpenCV and the previoously selected XML files to find any faces and eyes in the picture\n",
    "    5. The comboImage object will then display the origional image with boxes superimposed over it showing the detected faces and eyes in blue and green and depending on if a face was found a corrisponding statment will be printed\n",
    "\n",
    "Webcam realtime face detection: (Image/Logic programming: Bruge, implementing machine learning: Eric)\n",
    "    1. Once the Use webcam button is pressed the computor's webcam will be turned on and using OpenCV each current frame will be turned into a comboImage object for later use\n",
    "    2. For the frame a simular process is done as the one above for a single image and the frame will be returned with boxes on it in realtime, which due to the constant frame inputs will give the appearance of a video\n",
    "    3. If the window is detected as closed than the program will stop taking and showing the webcam images and return to its default state"
